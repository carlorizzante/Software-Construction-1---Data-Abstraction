# Systematic Program Design - Final Problems
Release 0.0.1

Notes and solutions for problems collected while studying Systematic Program Design.

> Writing code systematically follows the idea that the design of a function can be based on the sum of one or more templates and details that enables the program designer to think about programs in terms of higher level structures or models.

The code is currently written in BSL/ISL/ASL since those are the languages used to teach Systematic Program Design at the University of British Columbia along with the corresponding UBCx course. To run the codes presented in this repo you will need to install Dr.Racket.

Note that the entire SPD path has been recently restructured into a new set of 6 courses.
